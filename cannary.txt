This is standard Testimony (this should be signed again for each release, 
as a part of the text that is GPG signed, e.g. in gpg git tag comment
visible by git tag -v, not just as one of the files).

I hereby freely say that I am not, and I never was, and I do not suspect 
to be in foreseeable future, under ANY form of NDA, gag order, 
so-called 'national "security" letters', nor ANY influence, that could 
in any way affect following verification text and following testimony 
till end of this text:

The source code that I provide here, and provided in the past (e.g. in the 
git version that is signed with git tag containing this testimony) is to my 
knowledge free of any form of exploits, backdoors, security weakness, nor does 
it contain anything about what I can not freely speak.

I am under law jurisdiction: Europea/Poland (Influenced/subjected 
also by: European Union, and USA).

Always remember to check GPG signatures starting from root of trust, 
write down checksums too, if in doubt check sources yourself.

Builds/development/signature are done (at least) on: secure linux computer, 
not air-gapped.

Source code parts that are NOT audited by me are: kernel sources, 
grsecurity patch sources (but our scripts do check if they are properly
GPG signed by their authors - the scripts are seen here).
